# Basic Todo React App

## Purpose

This app is a basic todo app written in React Javascript. It was developed as a practice project to further my skills in components and react hooks.

## How to use

To use this app, enter the task you want to add to the list into the textbox and then press plus button located on right.
The app will register that task to internal local memoory and display a UI component.

Each todo item component has a completed button and a remove button, clicking on the completed button creates a visual reminder that the task has been completed. When clicked the remove button destorys the corresponding component and removes it from internal storage.

Another feature built into the app is the ability to filter by completed tasks, incomplete tasks and all tasks.
